# Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

> **"Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast."**

Specification-Driven Development (SDD) is a methodology that inverts the traditional coding workflow. Instead of rushing to write code, we first define **what** we are building in natural language, rigorous detail. This "referential integrity" between our intent (the Spec) and our implementation (the Code) eliminates the "assume and fix later" cycle that plagues modern software development.

## The Workflow in Practice

Instead of hacking away at features, we follow a strict Lifecycle:

### 1. Specification (`/speckit.specify`)
**Goal:** Define the "What" and "Why".
We start by describing the feature in natural language. The AI agent acts as a Product Manager, asking clarifying questions until a robust `spec.md` is generated. This document becomes the source of truth.

### 2. Planning (`/speckit.plan`)
**Goal:** Define the "How".
Once the Spec is approved, we move to technical planning. The agent analyzes the codebase and generates a `plan.md`. This plan maps the requirements to specific file changes, ensuring architectural consistency (e.g., sticking to "Mobile-First" principles).

### 3. Tasking (`/speckit.tasks`)
**Goal:** Define the "When".
The plan is broken down into atomic, verifyable steps in `tasks.md`. This checklist drives the implementation, allowing for granular progress tracking and easier debugging.

### 4. Implementation (`/speckit.implement`)
**Goal:** Execute.
The agent methodically works through the task list, writing code that strictly adheres to the Spec and Plan.

## The Constitutional Foundation

Our development is governed by a set of immutable rules defined in `documentation/AGENTS.md` and enforced by templates:

1.  **Mobile First**: The primary design target is always mobile viewports.
2.  **Single Admin**: Safe and secure edit access to the portfolio, CV matching, and blog/photography is strictly limited to one admin. Never implement multi-user write permissions.
3.  **Component-Driven**: UI is built using React, Vite, Shadcn/UI, and Tailwind CSS, prioritizing reusability and performance.
4.  **Local-First / Offline Capable**: A robust Service Worker is integrated using vite-plugin-pwa to ensure fast loads and offline browsing capability where relevant.

## Why This Matters

By front-loading the decision-making process, we:
*   **Reduce Bugs**: Ambiguities are caught in the Spec phase, not partially implemented in code.
*   **Maintain Velocity**: "Thinking time" is separated from "Coding time". When coding starts, it's just execution.
*   **Ensure Consistency**: Every feature, regardless of size, follows the same architectural patterns.
